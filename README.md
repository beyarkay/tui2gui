# Tui2Gui

### Convert your favorite TUI/CLI app into a web GUI

Often I've got a favorite CLI that I want to use, and want to use on my phone
while I'm out and about. However the open source community isn't great at
providing GUIs, so this will automate the heavy lifting for you and create
beautiful GUIs that interact with the shell in a secure way.
